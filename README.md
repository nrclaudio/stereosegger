# Stereo-seq SAW bin1 Quickstart

Convert a SAW bin1 `h5ad` to Segger parquet and build a dataset with grid-based transcript graphs:

```bash
python -m segger.cli.convert_saw_h5ad_to_segger_parquet \
  --h5ad C04895D5_tissue.h5ad \
  --out_dir /path/to/base_dir \
  --bin_pitch 1.0 \
  --min_count 1

python -m segger.cli.create_dataset_fast \
  --base_dir /path/to/base_dir \
  --data_dir /path/to/segger_dataset \
  --sample_type saw_bin1 \
  --tx_graph_mode grid_same_gene \
  --grid_connectivity 8 \
  --within_bin_edges star
```

Recommended defaults: `grid_connectivity=8`, `within_bin_edges=star` (optional), `bin_pitch=1.0` when coords are in bin units.

# Stereo-seq SAW bin1 Notes and Design Choices

Why SAW bin1 is handled differently:

- SAW bin1 is already a regular grid with counts per (bin, gene), not per-molecule coordinates. Treating each nonzero entry as a pseudo-transcript preserves gene identity while keeping bin-level counts.
- Grid adjacency is a more faithful neighborhood for bins than a distance-based kNN on pseudo-points. It keeps local structure consistent with the chip layout and avoids sensitivity to sparsity or count magnitude.
- The added `log1p(count)` feature lets the model see expression strength without exploding the number of nodes (no count expansion).

Definitions:

- Pseudo-transcript: a node created from a nonzero (bin, gene) entry. It carries the gene identity, uses the bin’s (x, y) coordinates, and stores `log1p(count)` as an extra scalar feature. It is not a single molecule; it is a bin-level aggregate.
- Grid adjacency: two bins are neighbors if their integer grid coordinates differ by one step. With 4-connectivity this is up/down/left/right; with 8-connectivity it also includes diagonals.

Graph mode guidance:

- `grid_same_gene`: connect same gene across neighboring bins. This preserves gene-specific spatial continuity and is the default for SAW.
- `within_bin_edges=star`: optionally connect co-expressed genes within a bin to share signal locally.
- `grid_bins`: optional ablation/debug mode that collapses nodes to unique bins with aggregate features.
- `kdtree`: original behavior for Xenium/MERSCOPE; still supported for SAW if you want distance-based adjacency.

Modeling choices and impact:

- Token-based gene embeddings (default): each transcript node carries a gene ID token, and the model learns an embedding per gene. For SAW bin1 this is the standard path because transcripts are indexed by `gene_id`.
- scRNAseq cell-type abundance embeddings: if you pass `--scrnaseq_file` and `--celltype_column`, Segger uses gene-by-cell-type abundance vectors as fixed features. This injects biological priors but requires gene-name alignment; missing genes are filtered.
- Count feature (`log1p(count)`): when a `count` column exists, Segger adds expression strength without expanding nodes. For token-based embeddings it scales the gene embedding by `(1 + log1p(count))`; for scRNAseq embeddings it appends `log1p(count)` as an extra feature.

Boundaries:

- SAW bin1 conversion can optionally write `boundaries.parquet` from label TIFFs.
- If boundaries are missing, dataset creation and prediction can still run in a prediction-only mode (no training labels).
